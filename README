milter-limit
============

This distribution contains the milter-limit program and its modules.  This is a
sendmail milter for limiting message send rate by sender.

INSTALLATION

To install the milter type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

*** YOU MUST ALSO INSTALL A PLUGIN BACKEND TO STORE STATISTICS ***

App::Milter::Limit needs a plugin to store mail statistics.  Two plugins
maintained by myself are App::Milter::Limit::Plugin::SQLite, and
App::Milter::Limit::Plugin::BerkeleyDB, which use an SQLite database, and a
BerkeleyDB database respectively to store the statistics used by
App::Milter::Limit.  You MUST install one of these plugins to use
App::Milter::Limit.

Download your desired plugin from CPAN, and follow their instructions to
install them.

CONFIGURATION

copy the configuration file conf/milter-limit.conf to
/etc/mail/milter-limit.conf and edit it to suit your needs.

The default configuration will use the SQLite plugin and stores statistics in
/var/db/milter-limit.

You also need to tell sendmail about the milter.  Add something like the
following to your sendmail.mc and generate a new sendmail.cf:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`milter-limit', `S=local:/var/run/milter-limit.sock')

Finally, you need to arrage for the milter to start at boot time.  some init
scripts are available in the contrib directory.
